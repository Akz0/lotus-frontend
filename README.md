# Lotus Wear

A ecommerce site built using the JAMStack approach. 

### Built Using :
- Next Js
- Tailwind CSS
- Stripe
- Strapi (CMS), Auth0
- GraphQL (Data Fetching)
- Cloudinary (Cached Media Delivery such as Product Images)


### I learnt : 
- Auth0
- Integrating Stripe through edge functions
- Deployments on Heroku
- Media Caching services 
- Managing and deploying graphQL APIs
- How a complete ecosystem of E Commerce (still left out the supply chain part) works.
